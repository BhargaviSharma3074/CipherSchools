and certain changes were made to app.js in src folder in order to explain

function App() {
  const name = 'CipherSchools!';
  return (
    <div>
    <div>
      <h1 style={{
        color: "red",
        textAlign: "center",
      }}>Hello from {name}</h1>
    </div>
    {/* must be wrapped in one parent element only */}
    <div>
      <p>Second div</p>
    </div>
    </div>
  );
}
